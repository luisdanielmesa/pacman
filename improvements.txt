The status of our program:
Most of the aspects of the game that we were hoping to implement were successful. PacMan
moves correctly and as expected, eats dots and ghosts, ghosts move in a (minimally) intelligent
way and can eat PacMan, score and level are tracked and displayed. Users can play 3 different
levels and can start new games.

We are aware of at least one bug. When PacMan is going off the board (to be able to wrap 
around to the other side of the board), if you hit the UP or DOWN key while he is in the 
last square before wrapping around, PacMan and ghosts freeze because an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds 
exception is thrown. But you can resume the game by simply pressing LEFT or RIGHT key again.
We think this happens because once we started accounting for the last direction PacMan was
moving in, it attempts to generate the potential location resulting from moving up/down 
(direction != lastDirection). But when it needs to wrap around, it reaches index 0 and 21, 
so even though PacMan would never successfully be able to go up or down there, it still
tries to generate this location. We couldn't figure out exactly where this problem was
originating (possibly in the setGoingOffscreenNewLocation() method), but we decided that
it was more important to debug/improve other situations of gameplay that arise more frequently.

The next improvements we'd like to make are allowing users to have multiple lives, having 
some text appear over the game board (such as "LEVEL UP" or points gained when ghosts are eaten),
possible a welcome screen or high score page, and improving the algorithm for the ghosts' movement.
